You can use remote debugging to debug Sling in Eclipse, here's a little How-To

start Sling from the command line with

java -Xmx384M -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=30303,server=y,suspend=n -jar org.apache.sling.launchpad.app-6-SNAPSHOT.jar

Open Menu Run-> Debug configurations

Right-click on "Remote Java Applications"
Choose "New"
In the "Connect" tab choose the Eclipse Sling Project for the field "Project" with the browse button
Let the Connection type be "Standard (Socket Attach)"
The host should be localhost
Set the Port to 30303
On the source tab click the "Add" button
Select "Java Project"
Select all Sling projects and click OK
Click "Debug"
Now you should be able to set breakpoints, evaluate properties, and so on as usual.
